# zabbix-to-slack
A shell script to send Zabbix notifications to Slack

This is the modification of original ericos's [shell script](https://github.com/ericoc/zabbix-slack-alertscript/raw/master/slack.sh). I just wanted to have the output more customizable. :)

Compatibility
=============

the script was tested on Zabbix v2.2, but will definitely work with higher versions as well.
